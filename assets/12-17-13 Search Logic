12-17-13 Search Logic
Current Search can recognize between authors and tags and recognize authors with 2 or 3 initials in the first name (CS Lewis + JRR ToLkien)

MAJOR update : a "tag" can refer to a keyword or topic. 
	a search parameter that is labeled as a topic by Brainy Quote will always redirect to use the topic url even if the keyword url is used.
	It is important to recognize the difference between keyword and topic. 
	
1.User enters a search parameter (queryText)
	queryText is parsed to remove all non letter characters.
2.We will run an author search (InitialSearch) with queryText.
	If running an author search with queryText returns a valid html page, then we can assume that queryText is an author
	If running an author search with queryText returns an invalid html page, then we can assume that queryText is not initially an author
3.If queryText is recognized as author, then we present the user with two search choices.
	ByAuthorSearch
		Search For Quotes by the author
	AboutAuthorSearch
		Search for Quotes about the author
	We must present these two choices because an author can be used as a keyword in Brainy Quote and the user may want to get quotes about the author
4.If query text is not recognized as an author, there are three possibilities with queryText
	(a) queryText is a tag (a keyword or topic)	
		ex) trees
	(b) queryText is neither a tag nor an author
		ex) asdfkajdlkf
	(c) queryText may be an author but the user is is using the author's common initials for first name
			The first name must have a length of 2 OR 3 => authorName[0].length() == 2 ||authorName[0].length() == 3
			We will return a specific error message for this.
				ex) CS Lewis is really : c/c_s_lewis, but the Initial Search reads it as c/cs_lewis which returns invalid page.
5. If case (c)
	We have recognized that the first word of queryText has 2 or 3 letters and could possibly represent a person's initials
	We must change the url accordingly => c/cs_lewis TO c/c_s_lewis. THis is done via generateAuthorWithIntialsUrl(String queryText)
	With this new Url we will restart the process with an author search (InitialSearch)
		If running an author search returns a valid html page, queryText is an author
			We display the user with two options
				ByAuthorSearch
					Display Quotes by Author
				AboutAuthorSearch
					Run equivalent of a tag search with the author's name.
						Display Quotes about the Author + Author of Quotes
		If running an author search returns an invalid html page, queryText is not an author. 
			We are basically in case (a) or case (b)
6. IF Query Text is not an author (case (a) or case (b))
	queryText can either be a tag or not a valid search query. 
		We run a tag search with queryText (TagSearch)
			We check if queryText is a keyword or Topic and pass the appropriate url to TagSearch 
			If running a tag search returns a valid page, queryText is a tag( keyword or topic)
				Display Quote + Author
			If running a tag search returns a valid page, queryText is not a tag nor a currently recognizable author
				Display error message.
