User clicks on the search button ... 
User sees the search dialog and enters some query string. 
User clicks on the search icon and we search the query.....

NOW.......

User presumably types in an author or topic

Topic vs Keyword?
	A Keyword search will redirect to a Topic search if the Keyword is a predefined Topic

	But we can not enter a Topic search with a Keyword... we can only enter a specified Keyword... 

	Sample URL for "random" : http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/random.html

Thus for topic search, we really will be using the URL for a keyword search.

IF we enter an author name in the KeyWord search, we get quotes ABOUT the author, not quotes by the Author... 
	Thus we must have a spinner.. 
		Spinner seems too much activity for a search, User just wants to search quickly
	Or some way to ask the user if they want quotes by author or about author... 


								Sample Cases.
	1. User enters a query
		ex) Random
	2. A keyword seach with Random is valid
	3. An Author search with Happiness is not valid.

			"Sorry this page is not available"

	1. User enters a query
		ex) Mark Twain
	2. A keyword search with Mark Twain is valid.
	3. An Author Search with Mark Twain is valid. 
	

	Thus... General Search Overview

	1. User enters a query
	2. Run an Author Search with the query in the background.
		- IF the link is invalid, we know that the query is a topic
			=> Run a Keyword search with the query
				IF Keyword search is invalid, user entered an invalid query
					=> return error message.
				ELSE return quote, etc. 

		- IF the link is valid, we know that the query is an Author
			=> Somehow ask user if they want quotes BY the author or ABOUT the author
				=> Based on user's response we return either keyword search or author search quote.
